The Kakuro file format consist of UTF-8 encoded plain text lines, which
denote commands, one per line.

Leading and trailing spaces on a line are ignored. Lines that start with a
hash (#) character (after optional leading whitespace) are ignored, as are lines
consisting entirely of whitespace. Other lines consist of words, which are
strings seperated by consecutive whitespace.

Words containing whitespace may be denoted by surrounding them with double
quotes ("). Inside a quoted string, special characters are escaped using a
backslash (\) followed by the character being escaped.

The file must start with a command denoting the file format used:
    %version kakuro 1 0

The file may contain an arbitrary number of Kakuro grids, encoded in a single
word. All other commands must start their first word with a character not used
in the grid encoding.

A file may define properties, consisting of two words. The first word starts
with an at-sign (@) followed by the property name; the second word is the
property value. For example:
    @author "John Doe"
Properties apply to the last grid defined before the property definition.
Properties defined before any grid apply to the entire file.
